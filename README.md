# Genesis Project 

## Introduction
Genesis is a pioneering initiative that seamlessly blends non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with real-world environmental action. Each Genesis NFT represents a tree that is planted in a global reforestation project, contributing to the restoration of natural ecosystems. By purchasing a Genesis NFT, you're making a sustainable investment, backing critical environmental projects, and becoming the owner of a unique digital asset. In essence, each Genesis NFT is unique, tethered to a specific tree in a particular location. 

## Genesis NFTs
Genesis NFTs are unique digital assets that represent real-world trees. Each NFT is associated with a specific tree planted in a global reforestation project. By purchasing and owning a Genesis NFT, you contribute to reforestation efforts, and in return, you own a unique digital asset that grows over time.

## Key Functionalities 

### Minting
To mint a Genesis NFT, you will need to use your STNEAR tokens. Each minted NFT represents a tree that will be planted in the real world. The minting process creates a unique, digital representation of your contribution to global reforestation efforts.

### Hydrating 
To ensure your NFT (tree) thrives, you need to hydrate it regularly. Hydrating your NFT requires STNEAR tokens. Regular hydration will ensure your NFT grows, representing your ongoing contribution to the nurturing of a real-world tree.

### Claiming
After hydrating your NFT, you can claim GNE tokens as rewards. The more you hydrate, the more you can claim. Remember, you can claim your GNE tokens only once every 24 hours, and only if your tree has been watered within the last 12 hours.

## GNE Tokens
The GNE tokens serve as a reward for your active participation in hydrating (nurturing) your NFT. You can claim these tokens based on how well and how often you have hydrated your NFT. The use of these tokens will be determined as the project grows, offering potential for exciting future utilities.

## Roadmap 
Genesis has a multi-stage roadmap that aims to increase the project's impact and usability.
